## FarmLog

***FarmLog*** is a tiny add-on for World of Warcraft that calculates the total vendor price of all items in your Inventory every time items enter (when looted, bought, traded, etc) or leave (when transferred, or traded) your Inventory. I earn gold farming rare or uncommon drops from groups of low-level mobs, and then selling them to the nearest vendor. This addon helps me keep track of how much gold I've accumulated.

*FarmLog* also adds a chat command, `/farmed`, that toggles the Inventory's worth bar on and off.
