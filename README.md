***FarmLog*** is a tiny add-on for World of Warcraft that adds a bar displaying the total vendor price of all items in your Inventory.  The worth is recalculated every time an item enters or leaves your Inventory.

I earn gold by farming pricey reagents (like Borean Leather) and uncommon drops, and then selling them to the nearest vendor. This addon helps me keep track of how much gold I've accumulated.

*FarmLog* also adds a chat command, `/farmed`, that toggles the Inventory's worth bar on and off.
